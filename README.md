# bootstrap-portfolio

This is my portfolio Web site, which is deployed on GitHub Pages. Currently it is a simple Web site that provides some information about me, links to the projects I've completed so far, and my contact information. 

This site uses bootstrap to ensure mobile responsiveness, and currently uses the default layout I created as part of my second homework assignment.
